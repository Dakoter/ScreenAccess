#### Currently tested resolutions: 
- [x] 1920x1080


#### All weapons that require an anti-recoil logic are supported now!
##### Some weapons are not `laser-like` explicitly for the safety purpose, if you want anti-recoil to be more precise `(and you are not affraid of ban)`, please fork the project and change weapon logic in dedicated file.

#### Extra Info:

- Current version will create admin only access folder inside current directory after build, do not open it, because it will compromise the EAC protection. If you still did it - delete compiled sources and rebuild.

#### Is it safe to use? 
No idea, but I use it, and I've made everything possible from my side to make it as safe as possible.
